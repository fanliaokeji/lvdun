/* This file contains the generic routines for work with headers.
   Currently they are used only by HTTP in http.c, but they can be
   used by anything that cares about RFC822-style headers.

   Header is defined in RFC2068, as quoted below.  Note that this
   definition is not HTTP-specific -- it is virtually
   indistinguishable from the one given in RFC822 or RFC1036.

	message-header = field-name ":" [ field-value ] CRLF

	field-name     = token
	field-value    = *( field-content | LWS )

	field-content  = <the OCTETs making up the field-value
			 and consisting of either *TEXT or combinations
			 of token, tspecials, and quoted-string>

   The public functions are header_get() and header_process(), which
   see.  */


/* Get a header from read-buffer RBUF and return it in *HDR.

   As defined in RFC2068 and elsewhere, a header can be folded into
   multiple lines if the continuation line begins with a space or
   horizontal TAB.  Also, this function will accept a header ending
   with just LF instead of CRLF.

   The header may be of arbitrary length; the function will allocate
   as much memory as necessary for it to fit.  It need not contain a
   `:', thus you can use it to retrieve, say, HTTP status line.
