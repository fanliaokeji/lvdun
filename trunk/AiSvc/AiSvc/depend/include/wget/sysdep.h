/* OK, now define a decent interface to ctype macros.  The regular

   table-lookup, yielding random results.  This is, of course, totally
   bogus.  One way to "solve" this is to use `unsigned char'
   everywhere, but it is nearly impossible to do that cleanly, because
   all of the library functions and system calls accept `char'.

   Thus we define our wrapper macros which simply cast the argument to
   unsigned char before passing it to the <ctype.h> macro.  These
